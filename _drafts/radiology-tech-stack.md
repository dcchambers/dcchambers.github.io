title: Radiology Tech Stack
---

In January of 2018 I started a new job with the Department of Radiology in
the University of Wisconsin's School of Medicine and Public Health. Phew, that
was a mouthful. From here on out, I'll just refer to it as "Radiology."

Our department is dual-purpose. We support both academic research in the
School of Medicine, and we support clinical applications that are used every
day by doctors and staff in the UW Hospital and Clinics. We're a pretty small
team. Our core team is just five people - four developers and me, the dev/ops
engineer guy. We also work closely with our media team for graphics work
and some design/front-end work, and we work with the Server Team at UW Health
for our infrastructure needs.

So, what's in the tech stack for a unique group like ours? I could just go ahead
and list a bunch of tools without explaining *how* we use them - but my guess is
you're here to see *how and why* we use certain tools. It's easy enough to head
to a website like [stackshare](https://stackshare.io) and have a bunch of
technologies thrown at you without any indication of how they're used.
