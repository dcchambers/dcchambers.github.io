title: Radiology Tech Stack
---

In January of 2018 I started a new job with the Department of Radiology in
the University of Wisconsin's School of Medicine and Public Health. Phew, that
was a mouthful. From here on out, I'll just refer to it as "Radiology."

Our department is dual-purpose. We support both academic researchers in the
School of Medicine, and we support clinical applications that are used every
day by doctors and staff in the UW Hospital and Clinics. We're a pretty small
team. Our core team is just five people - four developers and me, the dev/ops
engineer guy. We also work closely with our media team for graphics work
and some design/front-end development, and we work with the Server Team at UW
Health for our infrastructure needs.

What does the tech stack look like for a unique department such as ours?
