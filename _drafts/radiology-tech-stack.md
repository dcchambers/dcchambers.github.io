title: Radiology Tech Stack
---

In January of 2018 I started a new job with the Department of Radiology in
the University of Wisconsin's School of Medicine and Public Health. Phew, that
was a mouthful. From here on out, I'll just refer to it as "Radiology."

Our department is dual-purpose. We support both academic researchers in the
School of Medicine, and we support clinical applications that are used every
day by doctors and staff in the UW Hospital and Clinics.

What does the tech stack look like for a dual-purpose department such as ours?
