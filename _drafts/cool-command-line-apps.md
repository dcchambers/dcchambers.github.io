title: Cool Command Line applications

INTRODUCTION
The command line...

This is not a list of useful command line tools (like `cal`, `curl`, etc), tips,
or tricks, but rather a list that focuses on more robust, full-featured applications
that treat your terminal window and command line as a first class citizen.

Here are some command line applications that I think are every bit as good (or
better) than their GUI counterparts.
