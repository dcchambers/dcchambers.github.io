title: Use an On-Screen Keyboard for Remote Code Pairing/Sharing

One of the things I found most valuable about working in the office with
co-workers was the shared learning environment. I can't count the number of
times I have been working through a problem with a teammate, either paired up
or just watching them do something, only to have them use some tool/shortcut
that I have never seen before and go, "whoa whoa whoa, what the heck was
that?!"

Watching someone else code and seeing the way they interact with software can
have massive productivity gains. Sadly, these are lost in a remote-first world. 

One of the ways to re-create this is to display an on-screen keyboard that
shows what keys you are pressing. That shortcut no longer has to be a mystery.
I'm not advocating you go and download a keylogger - macos has this capability
built in. [TODO - instructions]. This is definitely most useful for recorded
videos that you can playback, but it's also probably useful for live
collaboration over Zoom, etc.
