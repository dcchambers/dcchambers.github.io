I am a devout member of the bullet journal club. But I tend to be picky about what I write down
in my journal and, let's be honest, it's often faster to type than to write,
especially when you're already sitting in front of a keyboard.

Here's a note-taking system I use with a tiny shell script to make simple
notes (TODO lists, copy/paste clipboard, poems, etc).
