We use it for everything, and most of us have no control. It's kind of insane.

Take a few seconds and think about all of the accounts you've got linked to your email account. Social Media, Messaging, Entertainment, Video Games, Credit Cards, Bills, Rent, Banking, Taxes. The list is endless for most. Email has ingrained itself in every part of our day-to-day lives. Most of us check our email inboxes regularly. Many of us get a vibrating notification in our pocket or on our wrist the second a message comes in.

I don't want to appear to be hating on email here. Quite the contrary. I love email! The near-instant (but still ___ ) communication has shattered...

My fear is (founded) in that most of us have email addresses we have zero control over. Most of us could lose access to our email account in an instant, and in turn, lose access to all of our accounts that depend on that email address.

I've used the same primary email address, a Gmail address, for a little over 10 years. The thought of having to change it is horrifying. I cannot fathom the hours required to log into each service I use, each site I have an account on, and try to change an email. Some won't let you change a primary email address. For others, I have long since forgotten my password, and the only recourse is to have a temporary password sent...to my email account!

Last Summer I spent a solid week going through my email "backlog" of 10,000+ unread messages and purged it until that unread number was **0**.
