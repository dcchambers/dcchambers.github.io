It's interesting to look at how one's software usage changes over time.
Some people use the same tools for years or even decades.
Some people change productivity tools every six months.
While I do have a [uses](../_pages/uses.md) page that lists the tools I use to accomplish work and have fun on the computer I figured it would be nice to take a snapshot of the software tools I am using at a particular point in time.

Note that these are tools I use for my own personal projects and productivity, not ones that I use exclusively for my day job (eg Jira).
