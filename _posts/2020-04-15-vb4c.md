Introducing vb4c - Vim Bindings for Chrome!

![](/assets/images/vb4c-promo-title.png)

---

This is a blog post that I have needed to write for a couple of months now but
a certain [global health
situation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)
distracted me. But I'm settling into a life of self-isolation and am ready to
get back to working on this.

### TL;DR

[vb4c](https://github.com/dcchambers/vb4c) is a fork of the popular but sadly
abandoned Chrome extension, cVim. cVim brings vim-like bindings to chrome. It
work(ed) really well, but recent changes to chrome broke some core
functionality. A replacement was needed, so I decided to create a fork.

### The Road to 1.0

**vb4c** needs a lot of work. The codebase is pretty old. In case you aren't
aware, the javascript world moves along pretty quickly. Most of the code is
4+ years old. Or about 15 javascript years.

All jokes aside, I need to finish a deep-dive into the code base in order to
fully understand how this extension works. The chrome architecture is new to
me. I have worked with javascript quite a bit but I am *not* a JS developer, so
many of the intricacies are lost on me.

I do not imagine v1.0 will be a major re-write, but we will see what happens as
I continue to learn how the extension functions.

#### How We're Getting There

I have created a [project
board](https://github.com/dcchambers/vb4c/projects/1) in the GitHub repo. I
am going to need help with this, so I want to do all the work in the open.

#### Critical Bug Fixes

I have already merged in a few changes to fix bugs that broke core
functionality. Now that those changes are done, the extension is fully
useable again and can be manually installed. With that complete my next task is
to get this extension approved and listed on the chrome web store for simple
one-click installation.

#### Chrome Web Store

After merging the changes I quickly listed the extension for distribution in
the Chrome web store and was rejected. I am working to rectify the issues Google
had with the extension.

The reason for denial was requesting too many user permissions. I did not
request any more than the original extension, cVim, but I may have done a bad
job justifying why this extension needs those permissions. I am currently
working to better understand what the extension does with every permission it
requests.

#### Goals of 1.0 Release
- Fix critical, feature-breaking bugs.
- Get the extension approved and listed in the Chrome web store.
- Understand and document the code.
- Add CI tests.
- Make it easy for other to contribute to the code base.
- Improve logo/branding.

### FAQ
Q: Why was a fork needed?
A: See above.

Q: Why not use a well-maintained and feature-complete extension like Surfing Keys?
A: You certainly can! I liked the way cVim worked and wanted to keep using it,
but with the major bugs fixed.

Q: But you're not a javascript developer!
A: I'm not! And I will need help maintaining this. If you are a JS dev and want
to contribute to a cool open source project, please reach out to me.

Q: Why would you want to bring vim-like keyboard bindings to chrome? I thought
the mouse was the future?
A: Get off my lawn! Just kidding. Serious answer: you can be more productive if
you never take your hands off the keyboard. Also it makes you feel like a 1337
hacker.

Q: OK you've convinced me, how do I get vb4c?
A: I am working on getting this into the chrome web store. You can install it
manually following [these
instructions](https://github.com/dcchambers/vb4c#install).

Q: How can I contribute?
A: Check out the [repo](https://github.com/dcchambers/vb4c), fork it, open a
PR, or reach out to me directly.
