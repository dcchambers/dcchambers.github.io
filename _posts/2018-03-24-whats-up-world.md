Because `Hello, World!` is *sooo* 1976.

This is a technical blog.  
Let's get some *technical details* out of the way.
* The content is written in [`markdown`](http://commonmark.org/help/)
* The site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
* It's hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
* You can view even view the [source code](https://github.com/dcchambers/dcchambers.github.io).


## Why am I writing this?

One of my resolutions for :calendar: 2018 is to improve my writing.[^1][^2] It
turns out that in order to write *better*, you have to write *more*. I've been
[Bullet Journaling](http://bulletjournal.com/) for a while now - but that
doesn't really let me flex my creative writing muscles. I have already started
writing a regular journal, but I've been wanting to start a technical blog for a
while. There are a number of tech/programming/ops blogs I read religiously.
[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/),
[Rachel by the Bay](http://rachelbythebay.com/w/),
[Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/),
[Dan Luu](http://danluu.com/), etc. You know the drill.
Incredibly smart people writing incredibly well about incredibly cool<sup>and
some incredibly mundane</sup> things.[^3] I don't imagine my technical rants
will ever be seen in the same light as some of those talented individuals, but
maybe someone desperately scouring the internet for a weird Docker error will
stumble upon a post here and ~~fix their problem~~ become even more confused.

## About Me

I'm currently doing fun dev/ops stuff with the University of Wisconsin's
Department of Radiology. I help the dev team build and deploy their applications
using tools like Docker and Jenkins. We write mostly web-based applications and
manage everything from the [Radiology Website](https://radiology.wisc.edu) to
clinical applications that are used every day in the UW Hospital. We're teamed
up with the awesome folks at [UW Health](https://uwhealth.org) to provide
remarkable healthcare and do amazing research.

Before this I worked as a Linux system administrator at the UW
[Center for High Throughput Computing](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/) and at the
[Morgridge Institure for Research](https://morgridge.org/).

Outside of work, I like building silly applications and websites that rarely
ever get finished. I also enjoy dabbling in pixel art and drawing/animating with
CSS/HTML and SVG.

## What to Expect

Honestly, I'm not sure yet. I'm going to try *like really, really hard* to post
content regularly. I expect I will write about what I'm working on both
professionally and personally. I'll write about the interesting problems we
encounter and (hopefully) the solutions to those problems. I might write a
hands-on guide to implementing a technology or some long-form essays. I might
even write some fiction or share a joke.

It's time to sign off, though. This post is dated 2018-03-24 and I see the clock
has just ticked past midnight. My first post and I'm already breaking the rules.
:wink:

[^1]: I just realized the Calendar emoji :calendar: doesn't show the current date and for some reason that really bothers me.
[^2]: I also just realized you can create footnotes in Markdown. Awesome.
[^3]: Maybe I can expand my vocabulary :book: a bit, too? :wink:
