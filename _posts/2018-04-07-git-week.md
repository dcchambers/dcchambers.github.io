Git turns 13 today...which means it is officially in its angsty teenage years!
To celebrate, I'm doing a week-long miniseries on Git.

Here's a preview of what's coming up:

* [Monday: Git 101](/2018/04/09/git-101.html)
  * Have you heard all the cool kids talking about this magical thing called
  Git? Want to know what all the fuss is about but not sure where to start?
  Applying for a job fresh out of college? This is the lesson for you! Tune in
  Monday, April 9th for Git 101. I'll take you through a brief history of Git
  and version control, why it's important, and cover all the git basics so that
  you are ready to *commit with confidence*.

* [~~Wednesday~~ Thursday: Git for Sysadmins](/2018/04/12/git-for-sysadmins.html)
  * Most Git tutorials and lessons focus on using Git from a developer
  perspective. I'm going to tell you why and how you should learn git as a
  System Administrator.

* [~~Friday~~ Sunday: How Git Works](/2018/04/15/how-git-works.html)
  * A brief look at how Git Works under the hood. What the hell is a *diff* and
  why should I care? How is it so fast? What is so great about distributed
  version control?

* [~~Saturday~~ Next Week: Git vs. the Competition](/2018/04/17/git-vs-the-competition.html)
  * Git isn't the only (distributed) version control system...are the others
  worth looking at? We will take a brief tour of the history of version control
  systems to see how we ended up where we are today, and compare Git to the
  other options.
