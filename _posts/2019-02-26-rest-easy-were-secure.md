title: Rest Easy - You're Now Browsing With HTTPS 
---

As of today `chambers.io` is officially served up over `HTTPS`.

If you've read any of my previous posts - you might know that this blog is created with
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and it's hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Before, `HTTPS` was possible with GitHub Pages but it was kind of a pain to set up (well, not really
a pain, it just took more time than I had to spare). 

Recently...this past summer...okay not all that recently after all...GitHub made `HTTPS` easily
available for sites hosted on GitHub Pages that use custom domains. They also made it
easy to enforce `HTTPS` (redirect regular 'ol `HTTP` requests to `HTTPS`).

As an added bonus, this change also places my site behind a CDN - so it should load faster
for folks all over the world! ¡ɐᴉlɐɹʇsn∀ ollǝH
