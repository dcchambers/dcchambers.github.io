title: Linux & Unix Command Line Essentials
---

When I got my first SysAdmin job (as a Student with the [Center for High Throughput Computing](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu))
my Linux/Unix knowledge was passable but not great. I started to keep a list of commands I regularly used.

While the list has grown considerably over the years, it is expressive but still succint. It is *not* an exhaustive list of
all Linux/Unix programs and commands one should know. I do think it's a pretty good list of **essential commands you should know**
if you want to work with Linux (as a System Administrator, Systems/DevOps Engineer, or Software Developer).

You do not have to know exactly how they work or know every `--flag`, but these are commands that will be very useful in maintaining
a Linux/Unix system.

I migrated the list to a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/dcchambers/482bb55e0b20c55435a5c4658adde8c0) a while back and just
now made it public. Feel free to make a suggestion/contribution if you think it's missing something.

Cheers!
