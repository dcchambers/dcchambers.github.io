I'm joining [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/)!

Quick update with some exciting news. I am joining Zendesk as a software engineer on the Engineering Productivity team right here in beautiful Madison, WI.

So what does that mean? I could post the job description but that's boring. I am sure I will write lots about my experience over the next few weeks/months/years, but essentially I will be working with a team that supports the entire engineering staff at Zendesk. We create internal tools that are used by the entire staff to create amazing software that helps make Zendesk so great.

Look forward to more updates soon!
