Someone made a funny remark at work the other day. Before I begin, here's a
little background.

At one point in time, long before my own computing years, a command line prompt
and terminal window was the the primary - often only - way of interacting
with a computer. Today, the thought of using a command line is alien to many. I
was brought up in a GUI world, and I love every thing about it. Yet it is hard
to deny the (beautiful, brutalist) utility of the command line. It shows you
only what you need, it doesn't try to make things very pretty
(although [it can be](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/)), it's stupid fast,
and incredibly powerful.

I remember the first time I saw a true *Command Line Wizard* - my supervisor at
my first job as a student working for the Center for High Throughput Computing
at UW. I had used Linux before, sure. We used RedHat in the CS labs. I had
Ubuntu on my Laptop and I had installed a few applications using *apt-get* and I
had used vim and a shell to run simple bash scripts in some of my CS classes,
but I had never really *used* a command line until that job. My first day on the
job I saw down in his office and immediately noticed his screen was nothing but
a full screen terminal window. It was all I could do to keep my jaw from dropping
as I watched his fingers dance over the keys in an aggressive but deliberate
flurry of activity as he configured my account and showed me what I would do in
my new position. My first real introduction to the (Linux) command line was a
whirlwind, but I was instantly hooked.

I was lucky. My first real, technical job forced me to use Linux and the command
line. Often the best way to learn something is to throw yourself into it. The
situation for me was quite literally sink or swim. I floundered in the water for
a bit but I did manage to tread water, and eventually take some slow strokes
into what would eventually blossom into a job and career for me. I am now lucky
enough to work in an environment where I get to use the command line every day.

Fast-forward to the other day at work. While we use the Linux or Mac OS terminal
daily in the UW Radiology development team that primarily work with, the
Infrastructure/Server team at UW Health that I also work with is mostly
comprised of Windows administrators. It was at a meeting with members of the
server team that someone, reporting on a product they had just learned about at
a conference, said "...and the enterprise edition includes a graphical
interface, since the command line is intimidating."

Intimidating? How can something so simple be intimidating? Yet as I was sitting
in that meeting, all I could think about the rash of "enterprise-grade" tools I have to
use where I sift through a clunky web-app desperately searching for a way to do
something and wishing I could access a command line, knowing there's got to be a
simple flag to set this option. I'm not bashing GUIs or web interfaces. They are
awesome 90% of the time. However, it's that 10% of the time where 90% of the
work gets done that really counts. I love building interfaces and new ways for
people to interact with the computer on the web. But the command line will
always be one of the most powerful, simple, and elegant ways to interact with
a computer. It was all I could do to not stand up and yell 'blasphemy!' I wanted
to sit my co-worker down and show him the magic of the command line, right then
and there, and force him to see my point of view...no matter if I was right or
wrong.

I once feared the command line, but there really isn't any reason to.
Unsurprisingly, humans are pretty good with text. Using a written language is
second-nature to us. Computers work *really good* with text. It makes sense to
interact using written language.

It's undeniable that touch input, much like the mouse before it, has taken the
world by storm since *about* 2007, and that method of human/computer interaction
has opened up a whole world of new possibilities. There will probably be a new
way of interacting with a computer in the future. But I think there will always
be a place for a keyboard, a simple terminal window, and a blinking cursor.

Don't fear the command line - use it.
