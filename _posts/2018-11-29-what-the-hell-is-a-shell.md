title: What the Hell is a Shell?
---

You see the term 'Shell' tossed around a lot these days. The Bourne Shell (sh),
Bash (Bourne Again Shell), Powershell, etc. What actually is a "shell"?

> Put simply, a shell is an interface that lets a user interact with the Operating
System. A shell could be a command-line interface or a graphical user interface.

For the purpose of this post, we'll be looking at command-line interface shells.
I wanted to do a couple of posts about the Linux/Unix Command Line and thought
it would be good to dive right in and explore a Unix (or Unix-like) Shell.

Many people will often times use words like terminal, command-line, shell, or
bash interchangeably - but it's important to note the difference. Let's start
with some terminology.

Terminology:

* **Terminal** - the actual window filled with text. When most people say "terminal"
they actually mean "terminal emulator" - and it does just that. It *emulates* an
old school video or text terminal within your operating system.
  * Most Unix or Unix-like operating systems ship with a default terminal
  emulator, but you can install others without issue.
* **Command Line** - the actual place where you enter your commands. Letters appear
here when you type on your keyboard. Usually has a blinking cursor.
* **Shell** - the software that runs inside the terminal window and sends your
commands to the operating system. Some examples:
  * Bourne Shell and Bash
  * Powershell
  * Zsh
  * Fish Shell
  * ...and many more!
