Hey, I'm Dakota.

I'm currently doing fun dev/ops stuff with the University of Wisconsin's
Department of Radiology. I help the dev team build and deploy their applications
using tools like Docker and Jenkins. We write mostly web-based applications and
manage everything from the [Radiology Website](https://radiology.wisc.edu) to
clinical applications that are used every day in the UW Hospital. We're teamed
up with the awesome folks at [UW Health](https://uwhealth.org) to provide
remarkable healthcare and do amazing research.

Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/dcchambers) or read some of my
[technical writing](http://chambers.io).
