Quick update - I have enabled comments for blog posts on [chambers.io].
Scroll to the bottom of the page to check it out!

Comments use the [giscus] commenting system.
The system uses GitHub Discussions as a database for comments.
Comments are then loaded by the page using the GitHub API.

It does require a github account to comment, but given that this blog is mostly technical that's probably not a barrier for most people.
Don't have an account yet? GitHub accounts are free and open to anyone, even if you don't write code (yet!?).
Learn more at [github.com]

Lastly, you can view all comment threads in the Discussion tab for this blog's [github repo].
