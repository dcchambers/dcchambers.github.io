title: "Hire Junior Employees"

Abandoning junior roles in your company is a life-or-death bet that AI will eventually replace ALL roles.

Because those senior employees will **not** be around forever and you have effectively killed your talent development and knowledge transfer pipeline.

If AI developments stall out, if the AI agents that are promised never materialize, if we stop short of AGI and you need to keep humans employeed, your company will die.

Don't take that risk. Hire juniors. Train them. Pay them what they deserve, and give them meaningful raises to keep them around. Give them an ounce of trust, a bucket of agency, and watch them flourish.
