This is a really cool utility, and it's pretty quick too.
It generates reports for small repositories almost instantly.

For a large Rails monolith that is 18 years old, has 1695 unique committers, and more than 220,000 commits it generates the report in less than three seconds.

```
time git who
...
real    0m2.885s
user    0m2.711s
sys     0m0.767s
```
