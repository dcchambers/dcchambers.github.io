:book: Books I own! :book:

I have not read all of them, and some of them I have read several times. Links
to reviews are included if I have reviewed them. These are all of the physical
books that I own, or at least the ones I care enough about to categorize and
keep track of. I take advantage of the library and eBooks quite a bit as well.
Some day I may attempt to list those too.
