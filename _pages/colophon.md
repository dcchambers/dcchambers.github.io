This Colophon[^1] is inspired by [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/)

## Technology

This website is build using the very popular and powerful [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator.
The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dcchambers/dcchambers.github.io).

It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which has ample free hosting for most blogs unless you're getting a ton of traffic.
GitHub Pages also has first-class support for Jekyll so launching a site is dead simple.

It's 100% static with no dynamically generated content, which keeps it simple and prevents the need for a backend database.
There is no CMS - only plain text files written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and stored in a git repo.
A nice benefit is that this keeps the content free and easy to move around to other platforms.
I had maintained a wordpress blog in the past but I definitely prefer this method.

The current theme is the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme by Michael Rose with the default color scheme.
It's been a great theme that has served me well for more than six years, but I am currently working on [my own theme,called Oliver](https://github.com/dcchambers/oliver) to replace it.

## Writing

Often for smaller pages or updates I write directly in my code editor (vim, VS Code, or Zed).
Larger blog posts start life in Obsidian before I copy them into this repository.

When I have questions about style, grammar, or spelling, I refer to the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) and the [Webster's Collegiate Dictionary](https://shop.merriam-webster.com/products/merriam-websters-collegiate-dictionary-eleventh-edition).
This is definitely a relic from my years of writing in college, but I love them both.
Yes, I have physical copies of both within reach of my seat at the desk in my study.
