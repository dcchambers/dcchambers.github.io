Hey, I'm Dakota!

I'm a software engineer at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com)!

I enjoy hacking on containers with Docker and Kubernetes, building robust, automated CI/CD pipelines, automating infrastructure and ops, and building applications with Ruby, Go, Python, Bash, and more. Everything I do is in Linux or Unix (Mac OS)!

My professional experience ranges from Linux Systems Administration to DevOps Engineer and Software Engineer.
Feel free to check out my [Resume/CV](https://github.com/dcchambers/resume).

Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/dcchambers) or read some of my [technical writing](http://chambers.io).

When I'm not on a computer I enjoy reading, running, biking, cooking, watersports, and hanging out with my wife, LeeAnn, and our dog, Atlas.
