Hey, I'm Dakota!

I'm a software engineer at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com) working on the Engineering Productivity - Deploy team.
We build tools for configuring and deploying software to millions of customers around the world.

When I'm not in front of a computer I enjoy running, biking, reading, baking sourdough bread and pizza, and drinking coffee.
I live in Madison, WI with my wife, two young kids, and dog.
