I like to track the beer I drink with Untappd and wanted something similar for
Coffee. Nothing exists, so I keep track of the coffees I drink here. These are
mostly just coffees I buy by-the-bag and have at home. I drink a lot of coffee
while out but I don't keep track of that.

Generally purchased whole-bean, ground fresh with a burr grinder, and brewed
with a french press or pour-over. Sorted with most recent at the top.

- One of my favorite blends and one of my early introductions to high end coffee.

### January

#### Just Coffee - Laos Peaberry
![](/assets/images/coffee/just_coffee_laos_peaberry.jpg)

- Very interested to see what another Peaberry coffee will taste like. I love
  the Tanzanian Peaberry from EVP...and it will be interesting to see how the
  growing region affects the flavor.

#### Sip of Hope - Conversation Starter

- Pretty much the perfect blend. So well balanced, drinkable, and delicious.

#### Sip of Hope - Mexico Nayarit Natural

## 2020

### 2020 Recap

- I drank a lot of fantastic coffee in 2020. One of the few upsides to forced
  work-from-home was that I drank a lot more coffee at home than usual. As a
  result, I was able to order more and try more coffees than usual. Here's a
  photo of all the coffees I had in 2020.

### December

#### EVP Coffee - Brazilian

#### Ancora - Holiday Blend
![](/assets/images/coffee/ancora_holiday_blend.jpg)

- Reminds me of coffee at grandma's house. It's a blend of both medium and
  darkly roasted beans and unfortunately I'm picking up some mild burnt tastes.
  The holiday spice is there, but it's a bit too dark for me.

### November

#### Sip of Hope - Conversation Starter
![](/assets/images/coffee/sip_of_hope_conversation_starter.jpg)

- Sip of Hope has started roasting their own coffee! The previous iteration was
  an awesome blend roasted by Dark Matter Coffee but I was super excited to
  give this a try. Their debut coffee is a medium roast from Mexico. Very good!
  Earthy with robust and roasty flavors, not much sweetness or fruit. Great in
  a french press. No bitterness or acidity. Could drink this all day long.

#### EVP Coffee - Tanzanian Peaberry
![](/assets/images/coffee/evp_tanzanian_peaberry.jpg)

- A personal local favorite that I haven't had for quite a while. Holds up
  well. Bright and fruity without being acidic - has a nice roasty flavor as
  well. 

#### Ruby Coffee - Gachatha (Kenya)

### October

#### Just Coffee Wake the Flock Up
- A perfectly drinkable blend of coffee and roast types. A little uneven at
  times.

#### Just Coffee Revolution
- A bit too dark for me. Tastes over-roasted and kills some of the flavors, but
  fans of dark roast coffees will like this.

### September

#### Madcap Party

#### Madcap Luis Reinoso

### August

#### Wonderstate Driftless

I'll call this a classic diner blend. It's a little bit darker than I would
like - has an ever-so-slight burn taste.

#### Wonderstate Guatemala Adenisa
