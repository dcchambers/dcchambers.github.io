I like to track the beer I drink with Untappd and wanted something similar for
Coffee. Nothing exists, so I keep track of the coffees I drink here. These are
mostly just coffees I buy by-the-bag and have at home. I drink a lot of coffee
while out but I don't keep track of that.

# Coffee I Drink

Generally purchased whole-bean, ground fresh with a burr grinder, and brewed
with a french press or pour-over. Sorted with most recent at the top.

## 2020

### December

#### Ancora - Holiday Blend
![](/assets/images/coffee/ancora_holiday_blend.jpg)

- Reminds me of coffee at grandma's house. It's a blend of both medium and
  darkly roasted beans and unfortunately I'm picking up some mild burnt tastes.
  The holiday spice is there, but it's a bit too dark for me.

### November

#### Sip of Hope - Conversation Starter

- Sip of Hope has started roasting their own coffee! The previous iteration was
  an awesome blend roasted by Dark Matter Coffee but I was super excited to
  give this a try. Their debut coffee is a medium roast from Mexico. Very good!
  Earthy with robust and roasty flavors, not much sweetness or fruit. Great in
  a french press. No bitterness or acidity. Could drink this all day long.

#### EVP Coffee - Tanzanian Peaberry

- A personal local favorite that I haven't had for quite a while. Holds up
  well. Bright and fruity without being acidic - has a nice roasty flavor as
  well. 

#### Ruby Coffee - Gachatha (Kenya)

### October

#### Just Coffee Wake the Flock Up
- A perfectly drinkable blend of coffee and roast types. A little uneven at
  times.

#### Just Coffee Revolution
- A bit too dark for me. Tastes over-roasted and kills some of the flavors, but
  fans of dark roast coffees will like this.

### September

#### Madcap Party

#### Madcap Luis Reinoso

### August

#### Wonderstate Driftless

I'll call this a classic diner blend. It's a little bit darker than I would
like - has an ever-so-slight burn taste.

#### Wonderstate Guatemala Adenisa
