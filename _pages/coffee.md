I like to track the beer I drink with Untappd and wanted something similar for
Coffee. Nothing exists, so I keep track of the coffees I drink here. These are
mostly just coffees I buy by-the-bag and have at home. I drink a lot of coffee
while out but I don't keep track of that.

Generally purchased whole-bean, ground fresh with a burr grinder, and brewed
with a french press or pour-over. Sorted with most recent at the top.

## 2022

In 2022 I switched primarily from using a french press to using a pour-over for my coffee.

### March

#### Wonderstate - Bloom

![](/assets/images/coffee/wonderstate_bloom.jpg)

#### Rusty Dog Coffee - Costa Rica Las Torres

![](/assets/images/coffee/rusty_dog_costa_rica_las_torres.jpg)

Wow! Kept getting pour-overs of this at [Broken Board Coffee] and eventually had to get a bag for myself.

### February

#### JBC - Alaka Ethiopia

![](/assets/images/coffee/jbc_alaka_ethiopia_2.jpg)

So good I went and got another bag just a month later.

## 2021

### 2021 Recap

- Despite numerous challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (labor shortages, shipping delays, etc) and crop/growing challenges due to climate change, I drank a lot of fantastic coffee in 2021. I was particularly impressed with coffees from Mexico and Ethiopia this year. 

![](/assets/images/coffee/2021_year_in_coffee.jpg)

### December

#### Stumptown - Ethiopia Single Origin
![](/assets/images/coffee/stumptown_ethiopia.jpg)

Shout-out to Jared at [Broken Board Coffee] for giving this bag to me!

#### Wonderstate - Revelry Holiday Blend
![](/assets/images/coffee/wonderstate_revelry.jpg)

#### Angels Share Coffee - Double Bourbon Barrel Stout
![](/assets/images/coffee/angels_share_double_barrel.jpg)

- Roasted by [Uncommon Grounds][] Roasters in Appleton, but aged in bourbon barrels by Angel's Share Coffee Company. I'm glad I tried this, and I appreciate what they're doing, but I don't think barrel aged coffes are for me. I **should** love them because I love bourbons and barrel-aged stouts, but they just don't seem right to me.

### November

#### Ruby - Gesha Village Honey
![](/assets/images/coffee/ruby_gesha_villages.jpg)

#### Ruby - Gesha Village Washed

#### Ruby - Cheers
![](/assets/images/coffee/ruby_cheers.jpg)

#### Black & White - Birthday Blend 2021
![](/assets/images/coffee/bw_birthday_2021.jpg)

### September

#### Just Coffee - Just Bikes
![](/assets/images/coffee/justcoffee_justbikes.jpg)

- Apparently September is [Just Coffee][] month :smile:

#### Just Coffee - Bike Fuel
![](/assets/images/coffee/justcoffee_bikefuel.jpg)

- This is my go-to for making cold brew coffee.
  - Costco sells a 2lb bag for $15. Insane value and great coffee.

#### Just Coffee - ¡Arriba!

- Such a great breakfast blend that we bought another bag!

### August

### February

#### Sip of Hope - Papua New Guinea Peaberry
![](/assets/images/coffee/sip_of_hope_papua_new_guinea_peaberry.jpg)

#### Colectivo Coffee - Blue Heller
![](/assets/images/coffee/colectivo_blue_heeler.jpg)

- One of my favorite blends and one of my early introductions to high end coffee.

### January

#### Just Coffee - Laos Peaberry
![](/assets/images/coffee/just_coffee_laos_peaberry.jpg)

- Very interested to see what another Peaberry coffee will taste like. I love
  the Tanzanian Peaberry from EVP...and it will be interesting to see how the
  growing region affects the flavor.

#### Sip of Hope - Conversation Starter

- Pretty much the perfect blend. So well balanced, drinkable, and delicious.

#### Sip of Hope - Mexico Nayarit Natural

## 2020

### 2020 Recap

- I drank a lot of fantastic coffee in 2020. One of the few upsides to forced
  work-from-home was that I drank a lot more coffee at home than usual. As a
  result, I was able to order more and try more coffees than usual. Here's a
  photo of all the coffees I had in 2020.

![](/assets/images/coffee/2020_year_in_coffee.jpg)

### December

#### EVP Coffee - Brazilian

#### Ancora - Holiday Blend
![](/assets/images/coffee/ancora_holiday_blend.jpg)

- Reminds me of coffee at grandma's house. It's a blend of both medium and
  darkly roasted beans and unfortunately I'm picking up some mild burnt tastes.
  The holiday spice is there, but it's a bit too dark for me.

### November

#### Sip of Hope - Conversation Starter
![](/assets/images/coffee/sip_of_hope_conversation_starter.jpg)

- Sip of Hope has started roasting their own coffee! The previous iteration was
  an awesome blend roasted by Dark Matter Coffee but I was super excited to
  give this a try. Their debut coffee is a medium roast from Mexico. Very good!
  Earthy with robust and roasty flavors, not much sweetness or fruit. Great in
  a french press. No bitterness or acidity. Could drink this all day long.

#### EVP Coffee - Tanzanian Peaberry
![](/assets/images/coffee/evp_tanzanian_peaberry.jpg)

- A personal local favorite that I haven't had for quite a while. Holds up
  well. Bright and fruity without being acidic - has a nice roasty flavor as
  well.

#### Ruby Coffee - Gachatha (Kenya)

### October

#### Just Coffee Wake the Flock Up
- A perfectly drinkable blend of coffee and roast types. A little uneven at
  times.

#### Just Coffee Revolution
- A bit too dark for me. Tastes over-roasted and kills some of the flavors, but
  fans of dark roast coffees will like this.

### September

#### Madcap Party

#### Madcap Luis Reinoso

### August

#### Wonderstate Driftless

I'll call this a classic diner blend. It's a little bit darker than I would
like - has an ever-so-slight burn taste.

#### Wonderstate Guatemala Adenisa
