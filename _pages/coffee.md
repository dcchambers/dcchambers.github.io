I like to track the beer I drink with Untappd and wanted something similar for
Coffee. Nothing exists, so I keep track of the coffees I drink here. These are
mostly just coffees I buy by-the-bag and have at home. I drink a lot of coffee
while out but I don't keep track of that.

# Coffee I Drink

Generally purchased whole-bean, ground fresh with a burr grinder, and brewed
with a french press or pour-over. Sorted with most recent at the top.

## 2020

### October

#### Just Coffee Wake the Flock Up

#### Just Coffee Revolution

### September

#### Madcap Party

#### Madcap Luis Reinoso

#### Wonderstate Driftless

I'll call this a classic diner blend. It's a little bit darker than I would
like - has an ever-so-slight burn taste.
