## Recently

Happy new year!

2025 recap coming soon...

## Projects

- Building [Olima](https://olimahq.com) and [Olipods](https://olipods.com).
- [oliver - a jekyll theme](https://github.com/dcchambers/oliver) - a new design for my personal website.
  I really like Jekyll, but I have very little experience with frontend web development (mainly CSS), so it's been a good learning project.

## Reading

I often find myself reading too many books at once.

I am calling 2026 the "Year of the Chunky Book" since many of the books I want to read this year are...rather enormous.
