## Upcoming

In less than one week I will be running the [2024 Chicago Marathon](https://www.chicagomarathon.com/)!
My original goal when I set out training ~20 weeks ago was a sub-4-hour finish.
We're still a week away, but the future weather forecast is prediciting a warmer-than-optimal race day.
Given where I am training-wise, I don't think a sub-4-hour finish is likely, but I'm still going to try and shoot for it.
Realistically a 4:10-4:20 finish is more likely.
Ultimiately my primary goal is to finish without hurting myself!

I have put in the work and done the hours and hours of training (which is difficult with two little kids at home!).
Overall the body is feeling pretty healthy.
We'll see what happens!

  I really like Jekyll, but I have very little experience with frontend web development (mainly CSS), so it's been a good learning project.
