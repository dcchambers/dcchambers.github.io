## Recently

On October 12 I completed the 2025 Chicago Marathon with a time of 4 hours and 11 minutes - a 16 minute PR! I followed the [Hal Higdon Intermediate 1 training plan](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-1-marathon/) and have logged more than 800 running miles so far this year.

I took at sabbatical from my full-time job at  [Zendesk](https://zendesk.com) earlier this Summer. I spent most of my time off away from my computer, engaging in physical hobbies, spending time with my family, and traveling. Some day I would like to do a sabbatical where I spend time doing fun things on a computer (like the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)) but this was exactly what I needed to take a step back given the state of the tech industry.

## Projects

- Building [Olima](https://olimahq.com) and [Olipods](https://olipods.com).
- [oliver - a jekyll theme](https://github.com/dcchambers/oliver) - a new design for my personal website.
  I really like Jekyll, but I have very little experience with frontend web development (mainly CSS), so it's been a good learning project.
