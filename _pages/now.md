Last week (Aug 1-2 2024) I attended the [Madison+ Ruby Conference](https://www.madisonruby.com/).
It was a great experience and I will be sharing a write-up of my time shortly.

## Fitness

I am currently training for the [2024 Chicago Marathon](https://www.chicagomarathon.com/), and am running 20+ miles a week but will ramp up to 40+ miles/week in my training peak about a month out from the marathon. It's hard to get in so many miles with two young kids at home, so I usually run very early in the morning. Helps beat the heat, too!

## Projects

I am currently (slowly) working on [oliver - a jekyll theme](https://github.com/dcchambers/oliver) to use for my personal website. I really like Jekyll, but I have very little experience with frontend web development (mainly CSS), so it's been a good learning project.

## Reading

I am reading:
- [The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings)
- [A Dance with Dragons by George R.R. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13422727-a-dance-with-dragons)
- [How to Talk So Kids Will Listen by Faber & Mazlish](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/769016.How_to_Talk_So_Kids_Will_Listen_Listen_So_Kids_Will_Talk)

## Playing

- I am playing the new [1.6 Update](https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-update-full-changelog/) for Stardew Valley.
- Also continuing to slowly work my way through [The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom](https://zelda.nintendo.com/tears-of-the-kingdom/).
