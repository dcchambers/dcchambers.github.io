I am currently on sabbatical from my full-time job at Zendesk. In my month off I am working on projects around the house and will spend a bit of time traveling with the family. I am trying to "unplug" during this sabbatical which means as little computer usage as possible - trying to focus on physical hobbies and tasks right now.

## Recently

- I ran a half marathon race in May and finished with a time of 1:58:59.
- I released a new version of [Notekeeper](https://github.com/dcchambers/note-keeper) in March.

## Upcoming

I am currently training for the 2025 Chicago Marathon, using the [Hal Higdon intermediate 1 training plan](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-1-marathon/).

## Projects

- [Olima](https://olimahq.com) - coming soon.
- [oliver - a jekyll theme](https://github.com/dcchambers/oliver) - a new design for my personal website.
  I really like Jekyll, but I have very little experience with frontend web development (mainly CSS), so it's been a good learning project.
