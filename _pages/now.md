I recently completed a one month sabbatical from my full-time job at [Zendesk](https://zendesk.com). I spent most of my time off away from my computer, engaging in physical hobbies, spending time with my family, and traveling. Some day I would like to do a sabbatical where I spend time doing fun things on a computer (like the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)) but this was exactly what I needed to take a step back given the state of the tech industry right now. I am feeling re-invigorated and anxious to get back to work.

## Upcoming

I am currently training for the 2025 Chicago Marathon, using the [Hal Higdon intermediate 1 training plan](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-1-marathon/).

## Projects

- [Olima](https://olimahq.com) - coming soon.
- [oliver - a jekyll theme](https://github.com/dcchambers/oliver) - a new design for my personal website.
  I really like Jekyll, but I have very little experience with frontend web development (mainly CSS), so it's been a good learning project.

## Reading

I always find myself reading too many books at once.
