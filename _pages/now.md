Last updated {{ page.last_modified_at | date: "%A, %B %d, %Y" }} from my kitchen table at {{ page.last_modified_location }}.

It's the evening before Thanksgiving and I have two loaves of sourdough baking in the oven right now.
The house is quiet and the air is thick with the smell of fresh bread.

- 2024 October 13: I ran the [2024 Chicago Marathon](https://www.chicagomarathon.com/) and finished with a chip time of 4:27:09!
  - My time through the first half was 1:59:17. I started the race and hung with the 4 hour pacers for the first 16 miles.
    My legs and lungs felt good, but I knew my heart rate was too high to maintain that level of effort for another two hours.
    I started walking the water stations in the second half to make sure I was getting enough hydration, and slowly dropped back from my pace group.
    Mile 22 I really hit a wall and slowed way down, falling way off pace.
    Definitely a humbling final five miles, but it was a wonderful experience and I am already thinking about the next one.
    The crowd and energy in Chicago is unreal. 51,000 runners, 1.5 million spectators.
    Just a crazy fun time!

- Slowly working on [oliver - a jekyll theme](https://github.com/dcchambers/oliver) to use for my personal website.
  I really like Jekyll, but I have very little experience with frontend web development (mainly CSS), so it's been a good learning project.
