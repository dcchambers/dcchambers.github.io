Happy Ï€ day! And happy birthday to my beautiful wife!

Here's what I'm up to:

## Running

I am currently training for a half marathon in Madison in May, and after that I will begin training for the 2025 Chicago Marathon in October.

## Projects

- [Olima](https://olimahq.com) - coming soon.
- [oliver - a jekyll theme](https://github.com/dcchambers/oliver) - a new design for my personal website.
  I really like Jekyll, but I have very little experience with frontend web development (mainly CSS), so it's been a good learning project.
