The year is drawing to a close.
The weather is getting colder.
I'm starting to feel the itch to scratch some of those cozy winter hobbies.
I've been baking more sourdough, reading more, writing more, and drinking even more hot coffee.

I've also been feeling that productivity itch more and more as the new year looms ever closer.

I've been an avid bullet-journaler in the past, but stopped in early 2020 (partially due to COVID, partially for other reasons).
I do keep a physical notebook around at all times for jotting down quick notes, sketching diagrams, and doodling.
But most of my productivity has moved into software, especially for work stuff.
I finally got LeeAnn on board to try a collaborative TODO app, so we're using TickTick for shared TODOS.
And I moved almost all daily logging and general knowledge/notes to Obsidian over the past two years.

But I yearn for something physical again.
I am going to try bullet journaling again in 2025 (in fact, I'm getting an early start in December).
I don't expect to try and put everything there and it will mostly be a place to rapid log notes and ideas before they end up in an app or digital calendar.

- 2024 October 13: I ran the [2024 Chicago Marathon](https://www.chicagomarathon.com/) and finished with a chip time of 4:27:09!
  - My time through the first half was 1:59:17. I started the race and hung with the 4 hour pacers for the first 16 miles.
    My legs and lungs felt good, but I knew my heart rate was too high to maintain that level of effort for another two hours.
    I started walking the water stations in the second half to make sure I was getting enough hydration, and slowly dropped back from my pace group.
    Mile 22 I really hit a wall and slowed way down, falling way off pace.
    Definitely a humbling final five miles, but it was a wonderful experience and I am already thinking about the next one.
    The crowd and energy in Chicago is unreal. 51,000 runners, 1.5 million spectators.
    Just a crazy fun time!

- Slowly working on [oliver - a jekyll theme](https://github.com/dcchambers/oliver) to use for my personal website.
  I really like Jekyll, but I have very little experience with frontend web development (mainly CSS), so it's been a good learning project.
